        <h2>What is C Language?</h2>
        <p class="font1">C is a powerful general-purpose programming language. It can be used to develop software like
            operating systems, databases, compilers, and so on. C programming is an excellent language to learn to
            program for beginners.</p>

        <h2> About C Programming</h2> <br>
        <h4>Procedural Language</h4> Instructions in a C program are executed step by step.
        <h4>Portable</h4> - You can move C programs from one platform to another, and run it without any or minimal
        changes.
        <h4> Speed</h4> - C programming is faster than most programming languages like Java, Python, etc.
        <h4>General Purpose </h4>- C programming can be used to develop operating systems, embedded systems, databases,
        and so
        on.

        <h2>Why Learn C Programming?</h2>
        <p>
            <li>C helps you to understand the internal architecture of a computer, how computer stores and retrieves
                information.</li>
            <li>After learning C, it will be much easier to learn other programming languages like Java, Python, etc.
            </li>
            <li>Opportunity to work on open source projects. Some of the largest open-source projects such as Linux
                kernel, Python interpreter, SQLite database, etc. are written in C programming.</li>

        <h2> How to learn C Programming?</h2>
        <h4>C tutorial from Programiz</h4> - We provide step by step C tutorials, examples, and references. Get started
        with C.
        <h4> Official C documentation</h4> - Might be hard to follow and understand for beginners. Visit official C
        Programming documentation.
        <h4>Write a lot of C programming code</h4> - The only way you can learn programming is by writing a lot of code.
        <br><br>
        C is a procedural programming language. It was initially developed by <b>Dennis Ritchie</b> as a system programming
        language to write operating system. The main features of C language include low-level access to memory, simple
        set of keywords, and clean style, these features make C language suitable for system programming like operating
        system or compiler development.<br><br>
